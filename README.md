# About the Project
This project is a responsive and accessible portfolio website built with *HTML*, *CSS*, *Bootstrap*, and *custom styling*. The goal is to showcase my interactive design work, UI concepts, and product features related to the Moriden brand.

# Features
- Fully responsive layout using Bootstrap 5
- Modern and minimal visual design based on Figma prototype
- Navigation with dropdowns and avatar
- Hero banner and product cards with gradient backgrounds
- Dedicated About and Contact pages
- Accessible markup (semantic HTML, alt text, keyboard navigation)
- Optimized images using *<picture>* and *srcset* for responsive delivery

# Development Process
## What I Did:
- Designed UI in Figma (link below)
- Translated UI into clean semantic HTML
- Used Bootstrap grid system and components for layout
- Wrote custom CSS to match the design (colors, spacing, typography)
- Added responsive image support using *<picture>* and *srcset*
- Ensured accessibility by using proper HTML elements, alt attributes, and keyboard-friendly controls
## Challenges:
- Translating Figma layout into responsive grid layout
- Optimizing image sizes without losing quality
- Balancing Bootstrap defaults with custom styles
## What I Learned:
- Better use of Bootstrap variables and components
- How to make responsive layouts faster
- How to use *<picture>* and media queries to improve performance
